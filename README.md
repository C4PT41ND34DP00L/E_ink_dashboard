**SETUP**

I created a wiki for you to set up the project, please follow it and let me know if you have any issues

-run python3 dashboard.py to start it

**Note**

-This code is made for 7.5 inch Version 2 display, if you are using another type of display please consult the documentation and adjust accordingly

-go to this website for e-ink display documentation of how to set it up and get it to work on your raspberry pi  https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT

-I used a raspberry pi zero w for this project however it should wourk fine on any other Pi as long as it has GPIO headers

-This is my first project in github, I'm still learning all its intricasies, if something is missing please let me know

-Still learning Python and squashing bugs as I progress, there is probably redundancies in the code so be gentle with it, =)

-Have fun with it and do something awesome!
